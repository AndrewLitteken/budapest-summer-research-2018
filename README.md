# IRES Research: Architectural Support for Machine Learning, Summer 2018, Pázmány Péter Catholic University, Budapest, Hungary

I spent most of the summer of 2018 looking into how to improve performance in a [Matching Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04080) through the use of Locality Sensitive Hasing in order to decrease the memory used and time spent performing an operation.

## Matching Networks

## Network Generation


## Testing Inference Accuracy


## Results Summary


## Preliminary Extra Explorations

### LSH Specialized Planes


### Using LSH to Train Matching Network Embedding Functions
